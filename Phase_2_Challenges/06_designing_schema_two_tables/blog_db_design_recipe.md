# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
As a blogger
So I can write interesting stuff
I want to write posts having a title.

As a blogger
So I can write interesting stuff
I want to write posts having a content.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want to allow comments on my posts.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want the comments to have a content.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want the author to include their name in comments.
```

```
Nouns:

posts, title, content, 
comments, content, author, post_id
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| post                  |  title, content, 
| comment               | name, content, author, post_id

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `albums` 

    Column names: `posts`, `comments`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `comments` 

    Column names: content, author, post_id

## 3. Decide the column types

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: posts
id: SERIAL
title: text
content: text

Table: comments
id: SERIAL
content: text
author: text
```

1. Can one [post] have many [comments]? (Yes)
2. Can one [comment] have many [posts]? (No)


```

## 5. Write the SQL

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: albums_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
title text,
content text
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key second.
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  content text,
  author text,
-- The foreign key name is always {post}_id
  post_id int,
  constraint fk_post foreign key(post_id)
    references posts(id)
    on delete cascade
);

```

## 6. Create the tables

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
```
